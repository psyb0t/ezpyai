## Development notes

## TODO

- knowledge gatherer - implement semantic chunking
- prompt - add prompt enhancer
- prompt - add prompt compression using LLMLingua
- llm provider - optionally use NuExtract text to json model to get structured response(like instead of embedding the instruction to the base llm, take the resp and send it to nuextract)
